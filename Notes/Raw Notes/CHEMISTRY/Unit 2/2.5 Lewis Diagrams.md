many ways to represent molecules
- Word Form - $E_xA_x$ 
- Lewis Diagram
	- lets you see bond amounts, and where lone pairs are
	- represent chemical substances
	- shows which atoms are connected
How to draw a Lewis Diagram
- Bonds represented by dash, and 2 dots represent lone pairs
- Joints are replaced by chemical symbol of atom
Lewis Diagrams use dots to represent # of valence in any given atom
ex. H has one dot, He has two dots, Li has one dot
- where the dots are dont matter
You can form a lewis diagram by just replacing hydrogen with single dots in an atom

Steps to draw a Lewis Diagram
1. Count total electrons
2. count amount of molecules
4. determine least electronegative atom (center atom)
5. create a basic structure, and then fill in octet rule
	- note: some atoms like Sulfur and Phosphorous can expand octet to 12/10 respectively
