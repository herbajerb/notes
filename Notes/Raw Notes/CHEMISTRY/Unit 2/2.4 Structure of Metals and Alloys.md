Metallic Bonds:
- contain positive ions with a bunch of shared valence electrons (delocalization)
- conductive, malleable, ductile
- Compared to Ionic Compounds, metallic compounds can conduct because electrons can move
Alloys:
- Substitutional
	- two elements similar in size
	- one atom substitutes for another
	- Brass - copper & zinc
- Interstital
	- Atoms of different radii
	- smaller atom fills in spaces between atoms
	- stronger than base metal
	- Steel - small carbons in between irons
