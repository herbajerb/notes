Ionic Bonds - electrostatic attraction between cation and anion
Diagrams are generally represented with positive-negative alternating particles
- note: Ionic bonds are not made of multiple molecules, they are a massive solid
Conductivity:
- To conduct, you must have charged particles and freely flowing particles
- This is only achievable with molten ionic solids and aqueous ionic solids
