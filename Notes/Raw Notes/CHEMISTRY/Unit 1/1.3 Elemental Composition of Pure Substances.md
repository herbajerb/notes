Pure Substances have fixed composition
- Means that ratios are always known for the elements present in each sample
	- Also means that mass ratio is also known

Finding %Comp of each element ([[Abbreviation Guide|var.]]):
1. Find total mass of element: $Total_a = Mass_a\times\#a$
2. Find total formula mass: $TotalMass = \sum_{a\in E} (Total_a)$ 
3. Find % of total each element occupies: $\%Comp_a = \frac{Total_a}{TotalMass}$ 

Empirical Formula - Lowest whole number ratio of atoms in each element

Chemical Formula - Actual # of atoms of each element in a compound

Note: Experimental results are most often in empirical forms

Steps to find empirical formulas from physical mass ([[Abbreviation Guide|var.]])
1. Convert mass to moles: $Moles_a = Mass_a \div MolarMass_a$ 
2. Divide all by lowest number of moles
3. Use ratio to write chemical formula
	- be sure to make the ratios whole number ratios
4. Write answers as chemical formula
