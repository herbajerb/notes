In atoms and ions, electrons are thought to exist in main energy levels (shells) and sublevels (subshells)
- the layer on the outside are  valence electrons
- other layers are core electrons
- the configuration of electrons is often written as $1s^22s^22p^6...$ 
	- the coefficients are the shells
	- the letters are subshells
	- the superscripts  are the amount of electrons in that subshell
Aufbau(Building Up) Principle
 - Generally, electrons will fill lower levels first and higher ones later
	 - eg. s first, p next, d after, and f last in an energy level 
		 - d is lower by 1 energy level and f is lower by 2 though
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
- Determines relative energy of electrons in atoms/ions
- use radiation to remove electrons from ion
	- Valence electrons easiest to remove, and the more inward you go the more difficult it becomes (ref. [[1.5 Atomic Structure & Electron Configuration]] - Coulomb's law)
- Data is in the form of a graph with peaks
	- position of peaks is related to amount of energy used
		- higher number = more inward(ref. [[1.5 Atomic Structure & Electron Configuration]] - Coulomb's law)
	- height of peak is relative amount of electrons removed(same subshell)
