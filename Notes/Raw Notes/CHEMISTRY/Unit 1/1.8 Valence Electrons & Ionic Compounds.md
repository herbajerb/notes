Valence electrons are the electrons on the outermost shell
- They determine the likelihood of two elements bonding, and the resulting compound from the bond
- Needed for [[2.5 Lewis Diagrams]]
Ion Charges
 - Elements in same column on Periodic Table form same compounds
 - Charges Determined by Valence Electron number
	 - 1, 2, 3 valence is +1, +2, +3  respectively
	 - 5, 6, 7 valence is -3, -2, -1 respectively
		 - note that it is the negative version of the easiest change to reach a full/empty outer shell
