balanced equations can be used to represent physical processes
 - Example: 
$$H_2O_{(s)}\rightarrow H_2O_{(l)}$$
Balanced equations are used for chemical changes too
 - Example:
 $$2H_{2(g)} +O_{2g}\rightarrow 2H_2O_{(l)}$$
 Steps to balancing equations:
1. Find all of the elements on both sides
2. Find charges of both sides (if applicable)
3. Balance by changing the coefficients intuitively

Precipitation Reactions
 - Mixing two solutions together and a solid forms as a result
 - There must be a precipitate forming otherwise a reaction did not happen

Different Equation Types
- Balanced Molecular Equations
	- Show all species participating in a reaction
	- Show that mass is conserved
	- Example: $$2NaOH_{aq} + CuSO_4 \rightarrow Na_2SO_4 + Cu(OH)_{2(s)}$$ 
- Complete Ionic Equations
	- Show ions as separate particles in an aqueous solution
	- Easily Identifies Spectator Ions
	- Example: $$2Na^+_{aq} + 2OH^-_{aq} + Cu^{2+}_{aq} + SO_{4(aq)}^{2-} \rightarrow 2Na^+_{aq} + SO_{4(aq)}^{2-} + Cu(OH)_{2(s)}$$
- Net Ionic Equations
	- Don't include spectator ions
	- Only represent ions that are actually reacting
	- Example: $$2OH^{(-)}_{aq} + Cu^{(2+)}_{aq}  \rightarrow Cu(OH)_{2(s)}$$
