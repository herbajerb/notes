Physical processes 
- involve changes in inter-molecular attractions
- bonds usually are not broken or formed when undergoing a physical change
- Do not change the chemical composition of the substance
Chemical Changes
- Processes involving the breaking/formation of chemical bonds
- the chemical composition of the new substances are changed

These are not completely exact though
- some people refer to dissolution as both physical and chemical
	- ex. NaCl being dissolved can form ion-dipole bonds with the water, and because it is reversible can also be referred to as a physical change
