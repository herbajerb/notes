Many way of showing physical/chemical processes
 - Can use chemical symbols to indicate reactants, products, and states of matter
	 - Subscripts are used for the formulas, and the coefficients are used to balance the equations
 - Can use models to show reactions/physical processes
	 - This shows the differences in atoms, and shows you more easily where the atoms go and what happens to them
Solving problems about reactions
1. look at the reactants
	- Make sure that they match the equation
2. look at the products
	- make sure that they also match the equation
3. Lastly, look at the coefficients
	- make sure that the amount of molecules in the diagram have the same ratio as the equation
***You can also apply this vice versa when trying to determine an equation from a diagram***
