Water automatically ionizes$$2H_2O_l \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+_{aq} + OH^-_{aq}$$
because this reaction is reversible, the $K_w$ value is therefore $K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-]$  
At 25 Degrees Celsius, pH goes from 0-14
- More Hydronium($H_3O^+$) is acidic
- More Hydroxide($OH^-$) is basic
- equal of both is neutral
$$pH = -log([H^+])$$
7 pH is neutral
Notice as \[$H_3O^+$]  increases, pH decreases, therefore becoming more acidic
njumbers to right of decimal in pH are significant figures

pH-\[$H^+$] has the same relationship as pOH-\[$OH^-$]

$$[H_3O^+]=10^{-pH} \& [OH^-] = 10^{-pOH}$$
As temperature increases, $K_w$ increases
As temperature increases, more product is formed
Temperature favors Endothermic direction, therefore autoionization of water is Endothermic
