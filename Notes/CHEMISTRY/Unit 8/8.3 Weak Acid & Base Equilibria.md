Starting Example:
- Hydrofluoric acid, HF is highly corrosive and is used in many industrial applications. 
- What are pH and % ionization of 0.155M solution?
- $pK_a = 3.14$ 

| R   | $HF_{aq}$ | $H_2O_{l}$ | $H_3O^+_{aq}$ | $F^-_{aq}$ |
| :---: | :---------: | :----------: | :-------------: | :----------: |
| I   | $0.155$   | -          | $0$           | $0$        |
| C   | $-a$      | -          | $+a$          | $+a$       |
| E   | $0.155-a$ | -          | a             | a     |

neglect a in 0.155-a

$K_a = \frac{[H_3O^+][F^-]}{[HF]}$ 

$K_a = 10^{-pKa} = 10^{-3.14} = 7.2\times 10^{-4}$ 

$7.2\times 10^{-4} = \frac{[H_3O^+][F^-]}{[HF]} = \frac{a\times a}{0.155}$ 

$a = 1.06\times10^{-2} M$ 

$pH = -log(a) = -log(1.06\times10^{-2})$ 

$pH = 1.98$ 

$\%ionization = \frac{[H_3O^+]_{eq}}{[HF]_{initial}} = \frac{1.06\times10^{-2}}{0.155}\times100\% = 6.8\%$    


Ionization & Le Chatelier's Principle
- equilibrium constant doesn't change when molarity changes
- % ionization changes when molarity changes
- $K_a = \frac{[H_3O^+][F^-]}{[HF]}$ 
	- notice that when a solution is diluted, all molarity decreases
	- for acids, numerator decreases more than denominator
		- $Q_a < K_a$
		- reaction shifts to consume reactant and form product until $Q = K$ $\therefore \%ionization$ increases as molarity decreases

Important concepts:
- Equilibrium constants for weak acid and conjugate base as well as weak base and conjugate acid are related by $K_w$ at any temperature
- $K_a\times K_b=K_w = 1\times 10^{-14}$  
- At $25\degree$ C, $pK_a+pK_b=14$ 
- %ionization compares molarity of hydroxide formed to molarity of weak pase present for bases
- takes 2 steps to determine pH
