Atoms have a positively charged center and negatively charged outer layers

Coulomb's Law([[Abbreviation Guide|var.]]):
- Calculate Force between two charged particles
	- $\huge{F\propto\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}}$
		- Note that this means when r increases, F decreases by a large amount
		- This also means that when q is higher, F is higher
	- AP Exam will only make you use qualitative comparisons, not quantitative comparisons
