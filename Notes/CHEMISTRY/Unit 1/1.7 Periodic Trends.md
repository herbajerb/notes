The periodic table is arranged based on reoccurring elemental properties
- this phenomenon, called periodicity can make predictions of atomic properties

Trends along Periodic Table
- Atomic Radius - distance from center of nucleus to outermost electron
	- Increases going downward, and decreases going right
	- Higher charge on nucleus means that it can hold outer layer closer on same period
- Ionization Energy - How much energy is required to remove an electron
	- Decrease downward, increase to right
	- Lower Radius means more binding force (ref. [[1.5 Atomic Structure & Electron Configuration]] - Coulomb's law)
- Electronegativity - how likely an atom is to attract a shared electron
	- decreases downward, increases to the right
		- note that noble gases have very low/no electronegativity values (difficult to make them bond)
	- Completeness of subshell in same period determines electronegativity, while distance determines holding force of nucleus
- Electron Affinity - Energy Change when adding an electron
	- decreases downward, increases to the right
	- same idea as electronegativity - completeness is very good in nature
