Mixtures have more than one pure substance
- this means their compositions are often variable
- an example would be solutions
- be sure to note that molecules made of multiple elements are not mixtures

Elemental compositions of a mixture can determine the relative amounts of the substances that compose it([[Abbreviation Guide|var.]])
1. Determine moles of one element
2. Determine moles of molecule linked to element
3. Find mass of molecule
4. Calculate %Comp of molecule (ref. [[1.3 Elemental Composition of Pure Substances]])
