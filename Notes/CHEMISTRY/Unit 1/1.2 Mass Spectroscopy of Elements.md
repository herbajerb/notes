Mass spectroscopy is used to find the average atomic mass of an element
- this is achieved through finding the isotopes of an element and their relative abundance
	- this data is often represented in a bar graph with %Abundance as the y and Mass as the X, however X can also be Mass/charge

Question Types:
1. Estimate atomic mass given spectrum
	- Formula for finding Average Atomic Mass ([[Abbreviation Guide|var.]]): $$\sum_{a\in I} (Mass_a\times\%Abundance_a)$$
2. Identify element given spectrum
	- To find the Element from the average atomic mass, compare the obtained results from the periodic table & take closest value
3. Identify isotope given spectrum
	- Identifying proton count from info: $$\#Protons = Mass-AtomicNumber$$
