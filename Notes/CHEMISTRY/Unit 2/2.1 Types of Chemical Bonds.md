Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons (ref. [[1.7 Periodic Trends]])

Chemical bonds are the attraction between nucleus of one atom and an electron of the other

Types of Bonds:
- Ionic: transfers electrons completely
- Covalent:
	- nonpolar - equally shared electrons
	- polar - unequally shared electrons
- Metallic: electrons are shared across the whole system
generally: 2 nonmetals = covalent, metal+nonmetal = ionic
- not a rule, just a general trend
Bond Polarity:
- Difference in electronegativity values of two elements
- Atoms with high electronegativity have negative partial charge ($\delta-$)
- Atoms with low electronegativity have positive partial charge ($\delta+$)
