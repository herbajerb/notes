Lewis Diagrams
- although very convenient, they are innacurate
	- ex . methane is not flat although it looks flat
We can tell molecular geometry using VSEPR instead
- negative electrons repel each other due to coulombic forces
- electron domains are negative
- therefore electron domains repel each other
- Carbonate ion diagram example:
	- T shape diagram is not in agreeance with VSEPR
	- Y Shape is (repulsion equal)
Molecular Geometry:
- In the face of molecular geometry, each domain is pretty much equal (single double triple bonds equal) except lone pairs
	- lone pairs tend to repel more than bonds because they are not shared, and therefore closer to the central atom
- each molecular geometry has name:
	- two domains
		- 0 lone pair = linear
	- three domains
		- 0 lone pair = trigonal planar
		- 1 lone pair = bent(120)
	- four domains
		- 0 lone pair = tetrahedral
		- 1 lone pair  = trigonal pyramidal
		- 2 lone pair = bent (104.5)
	- five domains
		- 0 lone pair =trigonal bipyramidal
		- 1 lone pair = seesaw
		- 2 lone pair = trigonal planar
		- 3 lone pair = linear
	- six domains 
		- 0 lone pair = octahedral
		- 1 lone pair = square pyramidal
		- 2 lone pair = square planar
		- 3 lone pair = T shape
		- 4 lone pair = linear
- electron geometry is the form of the electrons, and therefore is just the domain count at 0 lone pairs
Polar Bonds
- When electronegativity between two elements is too high, the bond becomes polar, which means that electrons are more likely to be on one side than the other
- an example is SO, which has oxygen with a negative partial charge because it is 0.86 more electronegative than sulfur
When two dipoles cancel out, however, the molecule they are in is nonpolar
- molecules with only nonpolar bonds are nonpolar regardless of shape
- symmetrical molecules with identical dipoles are nonpolar
	- this includes trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, square planar, and octahedral
- other shapes with polar bonds will be polar
Hybridization
- when bonding, atoms will merge their subshells together depending on how many domains they will be forming
	- 1 domain = no hybridization, just S
	- 2 domain = sp hybridization
	- 3 domain = sp2 hybridization
	- 4 domain = sp3 hybridization
	- 5 domain = sp3d hybridization
	- etc...
