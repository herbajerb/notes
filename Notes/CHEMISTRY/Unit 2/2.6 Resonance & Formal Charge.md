Carbonate Lewis Diagram
- Has one C=O double bond, and two C-O single bonds
- if you draw it out, you can place the double bond on any side
- Lewis diagram of Carbonate doesn't accurately predict length
	- This is because the bond can change, and therefore all 3 bonds have same length (average of all 3)
	- some try to remedy this by drawing dotted lines, which indicates that a resonance exists
Formal Charge
- When two Lewis Diagrams are both valid, you can test formal charges to find the most stable version
- Calculating
	1. assign electrons to each atom: $$Electrons_{effective} = (\#Electrons_{LonePair}) + (\#Electrons_{Bonding}\times\frac{1}{2})$$
	2. Subtract from electrons: $$FormalCharge = \#Valence-Electrons_{Effective}$$
- The lower the formal charge numbers are, the more stable generally
	- Zero is best, however if formal charge is necessary then negative must be on most electronegative ion
	- charges must add up to charge of molecule/ion
