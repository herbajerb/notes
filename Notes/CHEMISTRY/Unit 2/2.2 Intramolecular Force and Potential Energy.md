Chemical Bonds: 
- Attraction between nucleus of one atom and electron of another
- balance between attraction (protons and electrons) and repulsion (protons and protons/electrons and electrons)
Potential Energy Curves for Covalent Compounds
- if potential energy > 0, the arrangement is unstable, otherwise the arrangement is stable
- if two atoms are too far, the force will be zero, indicating no attraction
- Potential energy at its lowest point is where bonds usually are
Bond breaking requires energy while formation creates energy
Bond order, length, strength:
- Single Bonds:
	- fewest shared electrons
	- weakest attraction
	- longest bond
- Triple Bond
	- most shared electrons
	- strongest attraction
	- shortest bond
- double bonds are somewhere in the middle
- Ionic Bonds:
	- Electrostatic attraction between cation and anion
	- explained by Coulomb's Law ([[1.5 Atomic Structure & Electron Configuration]])
- As you add bonds, energy increases, and distance shortens
